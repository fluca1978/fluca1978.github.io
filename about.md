# Me by *Computer Science*


I've always been fascinated by computers since the age of movies like *War Games*.
My very first computer was the very popular [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64){:target="_blank"} that my father bought to me and placed
into a wardrobe with an old CRT television. I wrote a few programs using the [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_BASIC){:target="_blank"} language, and did not found it very fun: spending so much time to get a bouncing ball on the screen seemed a waste of time.

A few years later my grandpa gave me an [Intel 8088](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088){:target="_blank"} based PC with a green monitor and, of course, a version of [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS){:target="_blank"}. I remember doing a recursive `dir` on the 50MB disk running for a couple of seconds!

I grew up and got an [Intel 486](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486){:target="_blank"} DX personal computer that I used to do some homework while attending school. I remember doing some spreadsheets related to my archery performances, as well as using it to print out sight notes.
After that a few [Intel Celeron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeron){:target="_blank"} PCs took place on my desk, then it came a laptop, and a lot of other hardware I really don't remember.

I attended the *computer science* course at my local university, where I was (badly) introduced to `Unix`, or better to `Linux`. I felt in love with the philosophy of the system: you were not limited in any way, you could just type and do whatever you wanted piping a few commands.

My first Linux distro was a *Red Hat 5.2*, and since I was still not aware of the `root` concept (in the sense that Microsoft did not have to teach you such concept), I had to install it over and over again because I was jamming a few configuration files...
At my fourth year of university I did switch totally to `Linux`, keeping around a bootable [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows){:target="_blank"} for those games and programs I was not aware of a substitute.

My first job, luckily, required me to manage a few Linux servers, so I had the chance to improve my skills on such system.
After a few years I met [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org){:target="_blank"} and [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org){:target="_blank"} and I switched to the Unix culture.
Today I use both Linux and BSD as my own operating systems, with the former being the leading OS.

Being a Linux/BSD user meant to me I embraced the *Open Source* culture to the point I believe it is the **only sane way of producing software**.
Of course this does not mean I will do and accept only Open Source jobs and tasks, I can work comfortably even in environments where the code (and/or data) must be kept not-public.


<a name="achievements"></a>
# Me by *Achievements*


There was a time when I thought achievements were really important.
Today I look back and truly believe
that is much more important to *demonstrate my value on the field, not on a piece of paper*.
By the way, if you are interested, the following is a partial list.

In the academic world:

* Master Degree in Computer Science, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, final vote `110/110 with honours`, year 2002
* PhD in Computer Science, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, year 2005
* Adjunct Professor, [Nipissing University](http://www.nipissingu.ca/){:target="_blank"}, years 2011-2014
* lecturer at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia for several courses including `Java, OOP, operating systems`, years 2003-2006
* lecturer at local high schools for `HTML, Javascript, networking`, years 2009-2014

<a name="skills"></a>
# Me by *Skills*


Not a complete enumeration, but this is what I use on an almost regular basis (years are roughly computed since *2020*):

* **Perl** - 18+ years;
* **Java** - 20+ years;
* **PostgreSQL** - 18+ years;
* **Linux** - 20+ years;
* **Emacs** - 20+ years (it was my **default editor since day one** and yes, I don't know `vi`!);
* **Git** - 15+ years, with a couple of years over **Fossil**;  of course I used also other systems;
* **SQLite** - 8+ years;
* **BSD** - 15+ years;
* **PHP** - 15+ years;


Of course, I do not declare myself a *guru* of any of the above, but let's say I'm not scared to sit in front of any of them.



On an irregular basis, i.e., not for production but for personal use, I deal also with:

* **C++** and **Qt** - no production experience, let's say I can manage them and got inspiration from such a great language and library;
* **Digikam** and **Gimp** - because we all need to keep clean our photo collection;
* **VirtualBox** - a good virtualization solution for testing other systems;
* **LibreOffice**, **Org-mode**, **LaTeX** - because my documents should look good;
* **Redmine** - a very rich issue tracking and activity manager tool I recommend and use;
* **Eclipse RCP** - up to version 3, it was a very inspiring ecosystem and the **SWT** was light-years ahead of other Java models (*AWT* and *Swing*);


There was a time when I was more a *sysadmin* than a developer, and back in those days I used:

* **FreNAS** - a good solution for home and business storages;
* **pfSense** - as main firewall solution;
* **netflow** - lot of data to shut up users;
* **OpenLDAP**, **Samba**, **NFS**, **Netatalk** - because you have to manage a lot of different systems;
* **Jabber** - because your users need to share an emoticon;
* **Wireshark** (even when it was named *Ethereal*) and **tcpdump**, because your network does not always do what you think. Thanks God
then came **netflow**;
* a lot of Unix daemons including *dhcp*, *sendmail*, *postfix*, *cups* and a lot of stuff like that to make your network appearing serious;
* **Zyxel** appliances including routers, wi-fi spots, firewalls, modems and alike;


Last but not least, I believe I'm *one out of few people* knowking the **Dataflex 3.1d** ecosystem, or ehm, I would not call
an ecosystem, so let's say I've spent around 10 years developing on such ancient platform. If you have such a system, chances are I can help you get out your data in a more portable way!

Feel free to search for **`fluca1978`** on the forums, mailing lists, IRC channles to validate the above.



<a name="username"></a>
# Me by *Username*


My public username is **`fluca1978`** and it has been for a while, allowing for you to scout the net searching for my very first steps.
I strongly believe in keeping the username the same to let other people know my achievements and experience, as well as a way to prove
how long I was around on a particular subject.

The choice of the username has a particular meaning. When I was a child and was learning to write, I used to sign my homeworks with
`F.Luca`, where of course the capital `F` was for **F**errari. Having fun on me, my parents were used to read the whole string without the separating dot, making therefore it `FLuca` and calling me with such nickname.
When it was time to set up my first internet account, as you can imagine, there was no combination of name and surname available for me, so I switched to old nickname, but there was no available `fluca` as well: in both cases I had to add a postfix number to say my account from another. Therefore I decided to place my year of birth, `1978`, which interestingly is the minimal and only set of numbers that I need to write my whole `d-m-y` birthday.

And that is how **`fluca1978`** took the field. Since then I changed a lot of account managers and service providers, so chances are you can find my username tied to different services, but you can be sure that account is mine.

Interestingly, I waited for my [archery career to stop before having a fully customized quiver](https://fluca1978.github.io/2009/01/03/dragoon-took-field.html) with my nickname on it. Please consider this does not include the number because, well, in archery the nickname does not care.

<a name="projects"></a>
# Me by *Projects*



Today I have very little time to start-up a project from scratch, and so I try to help (a little) existings ones.
That is why I like to participat in *Hacktoberfest* or *CPAN PR*, that allow me to contribute and learn without having to waste time.

For a detailed view on what I can consider *projects* see the [projects page](/projects).



<a name="blog"></a>
# Me by *Blog*


In this blog you will find random thoughts pretty much on computer science related topics.
I do write sometime personal things, but not very often.

The main language for this blog will be *english*, but please consider it is not my main language, so be aware of errors,
typos and false-friends ahead!
I will write in italian stuff that does make sense only in such language, i.e., localized material, but not technical stuff.

I've merged all the content of my previous blog into this one, so this is the right place to read on. However, converting
different post formats made most of them hard to read, especially for code and indentation, so please be patient while reading
old blog posts.

There is a **specific page with some [stats](/stats)** about the activity of the blog, and a [specific post with some notes about the activity.](/2017/12/12/HowManyBlogPosts.html).


<a name="emacs"></a>
# Me by *Emacs or Vi*


In the case you are interested in the *holy-war* of computer science, here it is my list of choices:

- Emacs or Vi? **Emacs** since day one. This also means I don't see the excitement behind projects like *Atom.io* or *Sublime Text* as well;
- Gnome or KDE? **KDE** since version 1;
- Firefox or ... ? **Firefox**, there was a time I used **Konqueror**, but I believe the former is better and ported to much more platforms;
- Thunderbird or ... ? **KMail** when I was using a mail client, today I read all my emails via web;
- Bash or Bourne? **zsh** as interactive, **Bourne** for scripting (one day I will learn *pdksh*!);
- Linux or BSD? **Linux** at work, **FreeBSD** in the spare time, with seldom usage of **OpenBSD**;
- Windows or ... ? Isn't it clear from the above line that I do not use Microsoft Windows any more? Really, I cannot help you on any version of Windows more recent than XP!
- Apple or ... ? **or**, period. Having managed several Apple workstation in a mixed network I can say I don't like the way Apple does things, even if they are cute on eyes;
- Perl or Python? **Perl**, for whole life! It is not I don't like Python, it is just I cannot find anywhere else the same culture and approach that Perl has;
- PostgreSQL or MySQL? **PostgreSQL** because I believe it is much more superior and not driven by business;
- Gimp or Photoshop? **Gimp**, even if my parents were masters at using the latter;


<a name="social"></a>
# Me by *Social Networks*


No way!

I do not use *famous* social networks, or better, I seldom use them.
The fact is that I believe they are evil and so I don't like them. 

If you need to get in touch with me *drop me an email or a phone call*.

## "So why those  *social* links in your site?"

When I started to publish my technical books, I was *convinced* to push some advertising on social networks, and that is why I've added my social accounts up there. However, I do repeat it again: I don't like social networks and they are not the correct way to contact me!


Please note that this also mean I don't do any effort to keep my social profiles up-to-date, and this includes my
[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fluca1978){:target="_blank"}.


<a name="ages"></a>

<a name="beliefs"></a>
# Me by *Beliefs*


I do believe in *Open Source*.

I do believe in *automation*: why should I spend my time doing things the machine can do for me?

I do believe in *humanity*, *honesty* and *personal values*.

I do believe in *free culture*, in the sense that everyone should help each other to learn new things without secrets or speculation.

I'm not sure I'm catholic anymore, surely I'm not (and never was) a *blind believer*.


<a name="cats"></a>
# Me by *Cats*

**Long story short: there has always been a cat (or two!) in my life**.
For more details, see the [cats page](/cats)!


<a name="dogs"></a>
# Me by *Dogs*

I'm not a *dog-person*, **I do love cats and usually don't get very impressed by dogs**. 
However, a few dogs happened in my life and quickly became an important part of my day-to-day activities.
For a brief story see the [dogs page](/dogs).


<a name="university"></a>
# Me by *University*

Uhm, it's a long story, maybe one day I'll write it down.
However, I did attend the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia from *1997 to 2002 as a student* (yes, I was one of the first students using the "new" engineering department), from *2002 to 2006 as a PhD student and lecturer*.
If you have been around in those years, chances are we have met.


<a name="dolphins"></a>
# Me and the *Dolphins*

I've swimmed with the dolphins twice, and **it is one of the most exciting experience I've done**.
Both time I swimmed at the Malta Marine Park, and as far as I can tell it is a place where these great mammals are treated very well.

The first time I've swimmed was after the *EuroBSD Conference* in 2013, that took place in Malta. Reading a magazine on the flight, I learnt about the Marine Park, so I dedicated one day to go visit it and asked for a swim. Unluckily, it was required to book your swim slot in advance, but I was lucky enough to get a chance.

The experience was so incredible that on my tenth wedding anniversary I took my wife and son to do the same experience, and they have been both enthusiast!


<a name="interviews"></a>
# Me by *interviews*

I would never expect, but I got a few short interviews, written, spoken and video!

Check the [interviews page](/interviews) for an almost complete list.



# Contact me

If you want to contact me, please drop and email to [fluca1978 (at) gmail (dot) com](mailto:fluca1978@gmail.com). I usually reply within a couple of days, and as a rule of thumb I do reply to everyone who writes me.
