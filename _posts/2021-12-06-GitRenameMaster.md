When politically correctness goes too far...

# GitHub renaming master branches

TL;DR: [GitHub is asking developers to change the name `master`](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/){:target="_blank"} on their repositories because such term could lead to think about racism.

<br/>
<br/>
Quite frankly, I don't see that way! Luckily, [it appears someone else is like me](https://lore.kernel.org/git/a34e4244-835e-976a-8fb4-7fc766d100bd@gmail.com/T/){:target="_blank"}.
<br/>
While it is important to enforce correct behavior, it  making words to disappear is not a good change, according to me.
<br/>
**We are developers, we don't develop with *racism* in mind**, we take offence with bad code and pporly written snippets.
<br/>
**Stop abusing words to give them a meaning they don't have.** 
<br/>
It is true, there was a time when *master* and *slave* had a bad meaning, and there could be or will be times when these words could be used in a bad sense. But it is shame to hide our history, making words to disappear. If we stop using *master* and *slave*, it does not change the fact that in the past there have been *slaves*. It is an historical event (or a set of), no matter if you like the word or not.
<br/>
Not using *blacklist* is not going to change the fact that there was/is racism.
<br/>
None of these actions will solve any problem, rather they will create new ones.
<br/>
I'm scared to see good projects being absorbed by the *politically-correct* mindset.

<br/>
<br/>
And, out of curiosity, what about the evil *Master Boot Record*? Should we reformat every single hard drive on the planet?
