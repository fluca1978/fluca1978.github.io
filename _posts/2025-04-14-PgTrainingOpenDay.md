We are proud of what we have done in Bolzano.

# PgTraining OpenDay is over!

Last Friday was **[PgTraining OpenDay in Bolzano](https://pgtraining.gitlab.io/openday/){:target="_blank"}**, a free of charge day entirely dedicated to PostgreSQL, that we at [PgTraning](https://pgtraining.com){:target="_blank"} organized.

We hold the event in the spectacular *NOI TechPark* in Bozen (Bolzano), north Italy, and the room we had was simply amazing: everything was arranged in a very professional and clean way.

Chris, our *host*, Enrico and yours truly, had several talks with regard to cool topics like (but not limited to):
- vector support in PostgreSQL via PgVector, and what you can do with such a tool to create RAG applications;
- connection pooling (with regard to `pgagroal`)
- logical replication and hot upgrade.

The afternoon was a more practical part, when we displayed a few live demos to the audience.

All the material, slides and code samples, including a few Docker images, are available on the [PgTraining Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/pgtraining/slides/-/tree/master/OpenDay-20250411?ref_type=heads){:target="_blank"}, more material will be available in the next days.


As a joke, during the afternoon, Chris embedded the whole [Raku documentation](https://docs.raku.org/){:target="_blank"} in his RAG application and we enjoyed asking the application about how to connect Raku to a PostgreSQL database, with a couple of very detailed and accurate answers.

The audience was very interested in all the topics, and we are glad of such a good day.

We hope to be able to host soon another event like this, and we would like to get some more feedback, even "bad", in order to arrange an even better event!
