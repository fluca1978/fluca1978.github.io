USB sticks I found in the attic...

# PostgreSQL USB Sticks in the Attic!

**TLDR: this is not a technical post!** 
<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning the attic, I found a couple of old *PostgreSQL USB Sticks*.
<br/>
It happened that, back at the Italian PostgreSQL Day (PGDay.IT) 2012, we (at the time I was an happy memeber of ITPUG) created PostgreSQL-branded USB sticks to give away as gadgets to participants.
<br/>
The USB stick was cool, with soft rubber envelope, a clear white and blue elephant logo on its sides, the size of `4 GB` (that back then, it was quite common) and a necklace.
<br/>
However, it had something that I didn't like.
<br/>
So, when I was the ITPUG president back in 2013, I decided to change the design of the USB stick (as well as doubling its size).
<br/>
Let's inspect the differences, and please apologize if the sticks printing is not clear anymore, but well, some years have gone by:

</center>
<br/>
<br/>

The upper stick is the 2012 edition, the lower one is the 2013 edition.
<br/>
Do you spot the difference?
<br/>
Yes, **the 2013 edition USB stick did have the PostgreSQL logo on one side and the ITPUG logo on the other side**, while the 2012 edition did not have any reference to the organizing and local user group ITPUG!
<br/>
<br/>
When I decided to give a new spark to the ITPUG, I also decided to improve its visibility via such gadgets, that were too much generic and, for this reason, also re-usable in other events as PostgreSQL related gadgets.
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, such gadget was both presenting PostgreSQL and the italian users' group, no shame at all!
