Pushing PostgreSQL solutions to my own repositories.


# My Perl Weekly Challenge Solutions in PostgreSQL

Starting back at Perl Weekly Challenge 136, I decided to try to implement, whenever possible (to me), the challenges not only in Raku (i.e., Perl 6), but also in PostgreSQL (either pure SQL or `plpgsql`).
<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I modified my *sync script* that drags solutions from the [official Perl Weekly Challenge repository](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club){:target="_blank"} to my own repositories, and of course, I added a way to synchronized PostgreSQL solutions.
<br/>
<br/>
The solutions are now available on [GitHub under the `PWC` directory of my *PostgreSQL examples* repository](https://github.com/fluca1978/fluca1978-pg-utils/tree/master/PWC){:target="_blank"}.
