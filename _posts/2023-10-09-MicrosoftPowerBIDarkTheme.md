Apparently Microsoft decided user eyes must suffer!

# Microsoft PowerBI Dark Mode: no way!

I am currently using, at work, *Microsoft PowerBI Desktop* and while still learning how to properly use this tool, I searched for a *dark theme* for it because the white-gray approach used by this program is really a pain in the ass for my poor eyes.

Apparently, **there is no way to switch to dark-mode**, while it existed while before I started using this application. As [in this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerBI/comments/sxf4f8/where_do_i_find_the_dark_mode_in_powerbi_desktop/){:target="_blank"}, Microsoft decided to remove the dark mode.

As usual, with this vendor, **someone else is deciding how I (the user) must use my own software!**
