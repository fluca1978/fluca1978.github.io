I just donated to KDE!

# Donating to KDE

Almost every year I do a little donation to Open Source projects, and this year it was time to donate (again) to [KDE](https://www.kde.org){:target="_blank"}.
<br/>
I've used KDE since version 1, and quite frankly it has always been my only desktop environment: I never switched to another desktop, even if I've tried a lot of them.
<br/>
**KDE made my computer science a lot easier, I think it is correct to make the developers' life easier too!**
For this reason, I encourage everyone that is massively using an Open Source project to think about a donation. Even a small amount can do the difference!
