# OpenDay 2025 in Bolzano (Italy)

[PgTraining](https://pgtraining.com){:target="_blank"} is organizing the next year event, namely **OpenDay 2025** that will be held on **April 11th** in Bolzano, Italy.

The event will be **totally free** but registration is required because the room assigned has a fixed number of seats.

Please note that all the speaks will be in *italian*.


The event will be held at the NOI Techpark.




We are working on the schedule, but the day will be organized in a talks-session and a laboratory/practical session, the former in the morning, the latter in the afternoon.
