Me and Enrico talk about out latest book on Doug's Tech Bit show!

# Learn PostgreSQL - second edition - Tech Bits

I'm really glad that me and Enrico were hosted on the great Doug's **Tech Bits** show. You can see the podcast on [YouTube](Biblio/lib/Biblio/Schema/Result/){:target="_blank"}:



I would like to thank Doug Ortiz for his excellent work.
