Talks are listed in the same order they appeared in the afternoon on the live stream.

I would like to thank my friends Enrico and Chris for being able, again, to provide with me a very nice and interesting mini-conference.

We hope to be able to deliver much more PostgreSQL related content, and in the case you are interested and have  aparituclar subject you would like us to talk about, please feel free to contact us!
