Is there any pid 0 process running?

# What is PID 0?

What is the very first PID (*Process IDentifier*) running on your (Unix-like) operating system?

Well, as any professor will answer to you, **it is the `init` process that runs on PID number one**.

Then comes `systemd`, so, at least in many Linux distributions, the correct answer is **it is the `systemd` process that runs on PID number one**.

Unless you discover *there could be also a pid `0`*!

## Linux

*TL;DR*: in Linux it seems there is no PID `0` process, so you can quickly get back to your life (or read more on).

<br/>
<br/>
```shell
% uname -s -r -v
Linux 6.2.0-33-generic #33-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Sep  5 14:49:19 UTC 2023

% ps -p 0
error: process ID out of range


% ps -p 1
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
      1 ?        00:00:01 systemd

% pstree
systemd─┬─ModemManager───3*[{ModemManager}]
        ├─NetworkManager───3*[{NetworkManager}]
        ├─accounts-daemon───3*[{accounts-daemon}]

```
<br/>
<br/>


It is interesting to use `pstree` that has the ability to display parents and child of a given pid.

<br/>
<br/>
```shell
% pstree -p 0
?()-+-kthreadd(2)-+-UVM Tools Event Queue(682)
    |             |-UVM deferred release queue(663)
    |             |-UVM global queue(662)
    |             |-acpi_thermal_pm(88)
    |             |-ata_sff(77)
    |             |-blkcg_punt_bio(74)
    |             |-charger_manager(111)
    |             |-cpuhp/0(19)
    |             |-cpuhp/1(20)
    |             |-cpuhp/2(26)
    |             |-cpuhp/3(32)
    |             |-cpuhp/4(38)
    |             |-cpuhp/5(44)
    |             |-cpuhp/6(50)
...
    |             `-zswap-shrink(106)
     `-systemd(1)-+-ModemManager(1095)-+-{ModemManager}(1106)
```
<br/>
<br/>

So as you can see, effectively there is a *kind of process 0* that is the parent even of `systemd`.



## FreeBSD

On FreeBSD **there is a pid 0 process**!

<br/>
<br/>
```shell
% uname -s -r -v
FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE-p3 FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE-p3 GENERIC

% ps -p 0
PID TT  STAT    TIME COMMAND
  0  -  DLs  0:00.63 [kernel]

% pstree
-+= 00001 root /sbin/init
 |--= 00441 root dhclient: system.syslog (dhclient)
 |--= 00444 root dhclient: em0 [priv] (dhclient)
 |--= 00522 _dhcp dhclient: em0 (dhclient)
 |--= 00528 root /sbin/devd


```
<br/>
<br/>

Interesting, isn't it? While the system is effectively reporting `init` as the process parent of every other process in the system (see `pstree` output), there is effectively a process with PID `0` name `[kernel]`.
The status of the process, `DLs` means that the process is locked (`L`) on waiting for disk (`D`) and is a leader (`s`).

More information can be obtained asking about threads:

<br/>
<br/>
```shell
% ps -p 0 -c -H
PID TT  STAT    TIME COMMAND
  0  -  DLs  0:20.93 kernel/swapper
  0  -  DLs  0:00.00 kernel/softirq_0

  0  -  DLs  0:00.00 kernel/linuxkpi_long_wq_2
  0  -  DLs  0:00.00 kernel/linuxkpi_long_wq_3
  0  -  DLs  0:00.00 kernel/firmware taskq
  0  -  DLs  0:00.00 kernel/crypto
  0  -  DLs  0:00.00 kernel/acpi_task_0
  0  -  DLs  0:00.00 kernel/acpi_task_1
  0  -  DLs  0:00.00 kernel/acpi_task_2
  0  -  DLs  0:00.00 kernel/CAM taskq


```

So the pid `0` is *low-level stuff* (what a definition!), meaning it is the kernel running.


# Conclusions

There is pretty much always a *PID 0*, but sometimes the tooling prevent you to see it.
While I've shown that FreeBSD has one, as well as OpenBSD, even Linux does have a PID 0 process that is usually the kernel related stuff running.
