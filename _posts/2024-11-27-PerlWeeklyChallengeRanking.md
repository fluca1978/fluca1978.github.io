Little by little, I reached the top of the authors' rank.

# Is it really me ranked first in the Perl Weekly Challenge?

The Perl Weekly Challenge, now **The Weekly Challenge** is a very interesting project that I liked to join.

The idea is as simple as fascinating: every week, two problems are posted, and you have to solve them programmatically.
Initially, it was designed to be a Perl contest, hence *Perl Weekly Challenge*, but then people, including yours truly, started to post solutions in non-Perl languages, hence the change of the name,

I use this challenges to stay up-to-date with the usage of as many language as my brain can remember, that include Perl and Raku (of course), Python, Java, and PL/PgSQL.
This means that, usually, I post 10 solutions, and this gave me a quick jump in the amount of "contributions" done.

Today, **I'm listed as the number one contributor**!

Clearly, *quantity* is not the same as *quality*, hence being on the top of the rank does not mean that my solutions and implementations are the best, it simply means I did more code than other participants!
