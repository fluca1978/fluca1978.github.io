<h1>~</h1>


<div id="table-of-contents"></div>I decided to buy to my wife a couple of shoes with Foo Fighters printed on the sides, and of course this revealed to be a great mistake!<br />Usually I buy from good sites, and usually I check before buying, but this time I did trust who presented me the site, which is a kind of error I did not do being a very <i>un-trusty</i> man. And as a result, this story tells me to be even less <i>trusty</i> about what I don't know well.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-1"><h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> tl:dr</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">The short story is: I did not get the shoes I purchased, neither I got back the money and I did not get any kind of decent answer about what is going on. Consider that I placed the order about one hundred days ago, which is a <i>very decent</i> period of time to produce any kind of good.<br />On my email sent on the beginning of june I clearly stated I was going to put all the whole stuff on the net if I did not get any answer. I waited for another month, which is a <i>very decent</i> period of time to put together a couple of sentence and reply back, but nothing hit my inbox, so here I'm writing down all the whole "conversation" I did not have with folks at Royal Trendy.<br /><br /><br />I waited for an order update (or better an order shipping) for around <span class="underline">100 days</span> (yes, it is a very high number).<br />I wrote <span class="underline">14 emails</span> in the above period of time, and got <span class="underline">3 replies</span>, that is only 21% of my emails did catch the attention of the support center, and this is not what I would label a "good support".<br /><br /><br /><i>I URGE YOU TO DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ROYAL TRENDY SINCE CHANCES ARE YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR MONEY</i>!<br />It happened to me and to a lot of other people.</div></div><br /><div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-2"><h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> The order and the first problem</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">Just after placing the order I did not get any message about order confirmation. It was quite strange, since money was already taken from my credit card. I contacted the support staff, that told me I mispelled my email address, which sounds really strange since I'm used to write it down (as it is one of my job tools), as well as my browser has it already stored, but hey, I'm just an human being and errors could happen.</div><br /><div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-sec-2-1"><h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> 8 days and no news</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">After 8 days since the order date I wrote the following to get some news about my order.<br /><br /><br /><pre class="example">Luca Ferrari  Mon, Mar 20, 2017 <br />To: support@<br />Dear Royal Trendy,<br />I kindly ask for an update about order #4979 shipping to Modena, Italy.<br />According to the status page<br />the order has been accepted but not yet shipped.
