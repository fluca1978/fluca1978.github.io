A new release of pgenv that simplifies the management of PostgreSQL 17.

# pgenv 1.3.8 is out!

Yesterday, David Wheeler [releader version 1.3.8 of pgenv](https://github.com/theory/pgenv/releases/tag/v1.3.8){:target="_blank"}, that solves a few problems in dealing with the latest PostgreSQL release version `17`.

The build workflow of PostgreSQL `17` has slightly changed, so that new dependencies are required to produce the documentation. Thanks to the [work by Brian Salehi](https://github.com/theory/pgenv/commit/d97b0505fb067ee79c402800b72261317f715ae8){:target="_blank"} now the `pgenv build` command performs a `make world-bin` (essentially `world-bin` is the target to build and install PostgreSQL without documentation).
The documentation package is downloaded separately, since now the documentation pre-built has been removed from the source tree and is available as a separate tarball.

Moreover, this release includes [another Brian's little contribution](https://github.com/theory/pgenv/commit/f2a7486e7bf1dabd65c430f861160d9429d7c2ac){:target="_blank"} that improves the descriptive messages about dependencies.

Enjoy!
