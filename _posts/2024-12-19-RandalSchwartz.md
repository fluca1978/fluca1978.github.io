A very nice and clear interview with Randal.

# A very interesting piece of (Perl) story by Randal Schqartz



**I am a great fan of Randal**!
<br/>
This is not any news.

<br/>

I started to listen to Randal when he was a guest on FLOSS Weekly, interviewed by Leo Lamport and talking about the (at that time) not yet released Perl 6.

I read the alpaca book at list twice, and every time I start laughing at some example (for instance, `I'm a horse, of course of course!`).

Today I found another very great interview by Randal, that I suggest everyone, even if not a Perl-er, to listen to:

I really admire Randal and his great an shiny career.
