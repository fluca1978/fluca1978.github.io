# PgTraining Free Online Event: Material Available

The past Friday, on April 19th, we did our fourth edition of the webinar dedicated entirely to PostgreSQL, provided by [PgTraining](http://pgtraining.com){:target="_blank"}.

<br/>
As in the previous editions, we had three talks and an open discussion at the end.
The talks (**all in italian**) were:
- *Introduzione al linguaggio PL/Java* ("An introduction to the PL/Java language"), from yours truly;
- *PgVector - in R768 nessuno pu√≤ sentirti urlare* ("PgVector - in R768 nobody can hear you screaming"), by Chris Mair;
- *Repliche logiche e migrazione di versione a caldo da PostgreSQL 12 a PostgreSQL 16* ("Logical replication and hot upgrade from PostgreSQL 12 to PostgreSQL 16"), by Enrico Pirozzi

<br/>

The material is available [on our Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/pgtraining/slides/-/tree/master/webinar-20240419?ref_type=heads){:target="_blank"} and such repository contains also links and material from the previous editions!

Some material is still under upgrading, so if not already there, it will appear any moment soon.
