I reached two hundred contributions to the Perl Weekly Challenge!

# Two Hundreds PWCs and Counting!

With the **278** Perl Weekly Challenge, I reached the **two hundred solutions** almost in a row.

I started participating in the *Weekly Challenge* back in year 2020, and more precisely with the challenge number *43*.
Initially I did only Raku, then introduced PL/Perl to keep up to date with Perl (and PostgreSQL) also.
Then I introduced PL/PgSQL, to keep in good shape in PostgreSQL *pure* implementation too.

In the last year I added Python too, because nowdays I use such language in my day to day job.

Last, I added PL/Java because I'm no more using Java on my day to day job and I want to keep used to it, too.

This means that today, when I do a challenge, I produce two solutions in five different languages, hence producing *10* implementations.


How much did I code so far?

`cloc` reports a total of **`1233`** files, with 515 files in Perl/Raku, 244 in SQL, 51 in Java and 78 in Python, with other glue files 8e.g., Mavan configuration files).

In particular, in terms of pure code, I've written **`20961`** lines of code (excluding comments)!


Why are not all the challenges in a row?
Well, in year 2020 I had four months where I was not able to see, so as you can guess, I was not at my keyboard.
Moreover, there are holidays and particularly busy times, as in July 2023 when I changed my daily job.

All the solutions are grouped [on my personal repository](https://github.com/fluca1978/fluca1978-coding-bits/tree/master/PWC){:target="_blank"}.
