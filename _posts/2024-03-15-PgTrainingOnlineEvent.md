We are back with another event!

# PgTraining Online Event 2024 (italian)

[PgTraining](http://pgtraining.com){:target="_blank"}, the amazing italian professionals that spread the word about PostgreSQL and that I joined in the last years, is organizing another online event (*webinar*) on next **19th April 2024**.
<br/>
Following the success of the previous edition(s), we decided to provide another afternoon full of *PostgreSQL talks*, in the hope to improve the adoption of this great database.

<br/>
The event will consist in three hours with talks about **PL/Java**, **PgVector** and **hot upgrade via logical replication**.
<br/>
As for the previous editions, the **webinar will be presented in Italian**.
Attendees will be free to actively participate and do questions both during the talks and at the end of the whole event.
<br/>
<br/>
In the pure spirit of [PgTraining](http://pgtraining.com){:target="_blank"}, the event **will be free of charge**, but it is required to register for participate and the number of available seats is limited, so [**hurry up and get your free ticket**](https://www.eventbrite.it/e/biglietti-pgtraining-on-line-session-2024-04-863936706947?aff=oddtdtcreator){:target="_blank"} as soon as possible!
<br/>
The material will be available for free after the event has completed, but no live recording will be available.
