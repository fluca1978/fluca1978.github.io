With almost two months of delays, here it is the video of my talk at the Linux Day 2025 in Modena.

# My talk at the Linux Day 2025: ZFS

I finally found time to cut and upload the video of my main talk at the Linux Day 2025 in Modena: **ZFS, the Chuck Norris of filesystems**.
The video is in italian, and the audio and video quality does not depend on me.
Here are the links:

It was not my only talk at this Linux Day, since I also did a mini-crash-course about **git**, but unlikily there were no video for the course roooms.

This Linux Day was great thanks to the excellent organization by the LUG [Conoscere Linux](https://conoscerelinux.org){:target="_blank"} and [MakeIT Modena](https://makeitmodena.comune.modena.it/){:target="_blank"}
