An important contribution to `pgagroal`.

# pgagroal now has docker files!

Thanks to the [contribution of Arshdeep](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal/commit/c27c172caf836b93ec76c9c820ea997b6a19d3f0){:target="_blank"} now the `pgagroal` connection pooler has also docker images available on the repository.

There are two docker files: one based on Alpine Linux and one based on Rocky Linux 9.

Thanks to these docker files it should be simpler to test and do a play of the connection pooler.
