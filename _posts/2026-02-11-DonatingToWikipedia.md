A small donation, that can help freedom.

# Donatign (again) to Wikipedia

And it is that time of the year again: donating a small amount of money to Wikipedia and Wikimedia foundation.

Since I use Wikipedia, even if not daily, I believe it is important to support it. After all, even if I don't use it, my son does.

And this is  really important: **always provide support, even if small, to the projects that make your life better!**
