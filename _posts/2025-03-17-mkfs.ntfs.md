It takes a very long time...

# How long does it take for Linux to format a NTFS partition?

Linux is very good at handling a lot of filesystems, even the foreign ones, including Microsoft proprietary NTFS.

Not only Linux is able to read and write on such a filesystem, it can also format a partition or an hard disk with such a filesystem.
However, formatting a NTFS partition from Linux takes quite a long time...

TL;DR: **there is the `-f` (or `-Q`) option to `mkfs.ntfs` than enable quick formatting, that is your partition will be formatted in seconds or so**.

But what happens if you don't enable the *fast formatting* option mentioned above? According to the man page of `mkfs.ntfs`:

<br/>
<br/>
```shell
-f, --fast, -Q, --quick
              Perform  quick  (fast)  format.  This will skip both zeroing of the volume and bad sector
              checking.

```
<br/>
<br/>

In other words, `mkfs.ntfs` will check and zero the disk.

So, to get some numbers, formatting a `1 TB` hard disk (rotational) by Toshiba (via USB 3) tool:

<br/>
<br/>
```shell
% time sudo mkfs -t ntfs -L FLUCA_FILM /dev/sdc1
Cluster size has been automatically set to 4096 bytes.
Initializing device with zeroes:  100% - Done.
Creating NTFS volume structures.
mkntfs completed successfully. Have a nice day.
sudo mkfs -t ntfs -L FLUCA_FILM /dev/sdc1  0,00s user 0,01s system 0% cpu 3:03:53,28 total
```
<br/>
<br/>

It took **three hours** for the disk to be fully formatted, while enabling the quick formatting it requires one minute or so.
Erasing the disk with `dd` would have been surely faster (I've not tested, but I've done a lot of times before).

Quite frankly, I suspect that even Windows formats disks the quick way...
