# PHP and SQLite3 opening file when they don't exist!

A few days ago I changed a piece of working PHP code to handle SQLite3 databases in a better and more controlled way:

<br/>
<br/>

``` php
try {
    $database  = new SQLite3( $database_name, SQLITE3_OPEN_READWRITE );

    if ( ! $database ){
        $logger->err( "Cannot open database $database_name!" );
        return;
    }

    // ...

    $database->close();
} catch( Exception $e ) {
    $logger->warning( $e->getMessage() );
}
```
<br/>
<br/>

So far so good, except that *whem the file `$database_name` does not exist the file is not opened and an exception is raised*.
<br/>
By default, SQLite3 constructor [opens the file in read-write and create mode](https://www.php.net/manual/en/sqlite3.construct.php){:target="_blank"} and the documentation tells clearly that an exception is thrown on failure, **without specifying what a "failure" is**.
<br/>
It turned out that if the SQLite3 file does not exist and is opened to be written to, the exception is thrown and the program was crashing.
The fix was simple:

<br/>
<br/>

``` php
try {
    $database  = new SQLite3( $database_name, SQLITE3_OPEN_READWRITE | SQLITE3_OPEN_CREATE );
    ...

```
<br/>
<br/>

Why using the default flags? **Because depending on the version of the SQLite3 library version a warning is emitted if no flags are specified!**
<br/>
<br/>

The problem is, according to me, that it is not specified in the documentation that opening in `READWRITE` mode does not imply `CREATE`, that can be useful (not to me), but opens a problem.
