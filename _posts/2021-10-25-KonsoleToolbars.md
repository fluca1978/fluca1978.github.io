I want my applications to use as less decorations as possible.

# Removing Annoying Konsole Toolbars

After an upgrade of my KDE Plasma desktop, I started to see an annoying toolbar in my konsole window:

<br/>
<br/>
<center>
<img src="/imgaes/posts/KDE/konsole_toolbars_1.png" />
</center>
<br/>
<br/>

I [asked for help on the KDE Forums](https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=227&t=172499&p=449822#p448607){:target="_blank"} without any luck, and then someone on Facebook did replied to me and explained where to find this weird setting.
<br/>
For some reason I don't know, the toolbars are not fully configured within the *Konsole Settings*, rather there is a menu entry by its own: *Settings*, *Shown Toolbar* and there you have to uncheck the *Master* toolbar option.

It is rare that I don't agree with the KDE Plasma layout or setup, but this is one of that occasions. First of all, **enabling this toolbar silently** is really annoying for people like me, that want a minimal look and feel of their everyday applications. Second, there is no particular reason why such settings must be extracted from the application settings, that is where I would blindly expect to be.
