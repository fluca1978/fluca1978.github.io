This year I traveled quite a lot!

# Travels

This year, `2025`, I traveled quite a lot, after all. Well, not a lot, let's say, more than usual.

I started with a weekend in Naples back in January.

On April I was in Bozen, due to the PgTraining Event conference.

On June I visited the Pantelleria island with my family.

On July I spent a weekend in Krakow.

On September I spent a couple of weeks in the amazing **Japan** with all my family.

Last weekend, at the end of November, I was in Algun to celebrate the incoming Christmas!

I'm pretty sure I forgot something here, but this is by far one of those years where my suitcases did not get a chance to dust!
