A new release of the `pgagroal` connection pooler.

# `pgagroal` 1.5.0 released!

`[pgagroal](https://agroal.github.io/pgagroal/){:target=_blank}` is a fast connection pooler for PostgreSQL, written in the C language.
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago, a new release, the **1.5.0** was released. I'm writing about this just now because I was on holidays!
<br/>
The new release brings a new set of features, in particular a lot of small checks within the configuration file setup (e.g., avoiding duplicated servers or wrong parameters) and a lot of new loggin capabilities, including *log rotation* and *log line prefix*.
<br/>
Other areas of improvements include code clean-up, shell completion for command line tools, and portability towards FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems.
<br/>
Last but not least, a new set of [tutorials](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal/tree/master/doc/tutorial){:target="_blank"} will help the newcomers to correctly start using `pgagroal`!
