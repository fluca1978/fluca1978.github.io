# Learn PostgreSQL - second edition

On the last *Halloween*, the second edition of our book **[Learn PostgreSQL](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-PostgreSQL-manage-scalable-databases/dp/1837635641/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1TCXJ1I4KX16O&keywords=learn+postgresql&qid=1700582950&sprefix=learn+postg%2Caps%2C215&sr=8-4#customerReviews "{target="_blank"}")** has been released!

I'm very proud of all the work me, and my friend Enrico (co-author), have done to not only and merely update this revision of the book, which now cover **PostgreSQL 16**, but also to provide new content, examples and most notably, a new approach to help readers understanding the concepts expressed in the book.

In fact, with this new edition, readers will have access to a set of Docker containers that can be used to quickly fire up a PostgreSQL instance and get hands on the examples and exercises!

Moreover, every chapter now has a *Verify your knowledge* ending section, made of questions and short answers to point the reader to the most important concepts of the chapter itself.

While the overall structure of the chapter has remained the same, we got the great chance to improve almost all the content in order to better explain concepts and terminology.

I strongly believe **this is not a simple *update* of the book, rather it is a full _upgrade_! **

And after almost a month in the wild, the [reviews for the book confirm my feelings](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-PostgreSQL-manage-scalable-databases/dp/1837635641/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1TCXJ1I4KX16O&keywords=learn+postgresql&qid=1700582950&sprefix=learn+postg%2Caps%2C215&sr=8-4#customerReviews){target="_blank"}!

Similarly to the previous edition, a [GitHub repository with all the main examples, the Docker containers, and other gadgets is available](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-PostgreSQL-Second-Edition "{target="_blank"}").

As always, me and Enrico will enjoy any feedback and errata that can help us improve, and other readers to get a better experience.

And this post cannot conclude without giving a very warm and special thanks to our technical reviewers *Chris Mair* and *Silvio Trancanella*, who helped us a lot improving the quality and readability of the book.
I thank also all people at Packt that helped and assisted us during this work.
