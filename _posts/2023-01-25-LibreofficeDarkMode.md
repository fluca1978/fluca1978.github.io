A simple way to enable a dark mode to edit documents in LibreOffice.

# LibreOffice Dark Mode

I usually tend to use **dark mode colors** everywhere, since I have problems with my eyes.
<br/>
While terminal windows, my Emacs, and in general my KDE desktop have all the dark mode, editing documents with LibreOffice has always been a real pain to me.
<br/>
I decided to spend some time on this, and luckily *LibreOffice already provides a dark mode*!
To enable dark mode editing in LibreOffice you need to follow these steps:
- open a LibreOffice application;
- go to `Tools`, then `Options` and **`Application colors`**

Then simply select **LibreOffice Dark** as `Color Scheme`:

And that's it!
