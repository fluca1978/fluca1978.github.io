Yet another online event organized by PgTraining!


# PgTraining online webinar on 2022-04-29 (Italian)

[PgTraining](http://pgtraining.com){:target="_blank"}, the amazin italian group of people that spread the word about PostgreSQL and that I joined in the last years, is organizing another online event (*webinar*) on next 29th April 2022.
<br/>
Following the success of the previous edition(s), we decided to provide another afternoon full of *PostgreSQL talks*, in the hope to improve the adoption of this great database.

<br/>
The event will consist in three hours with talks about **connection pooling**, **timeseries extensions** and **column storage internals**.
<br/>
As for the previous editions, the webinar will be presented in Italian. Attendees will be free to actively participate and do questions both during the talks and at the end of the whole event.
<br/>
<br/>
In the pure spirit of [PgTraining](http://pgtraining.com){:target="_blank"}, the event **will be free of charge**, but it is required to register for participate and the number of available seats is limited, so [**hurry up and get your free ticket**](https://www.eventbrite.it/e/biglietti-pgtraining-on-line-session-2022-04-262565138397){:target="_blank"} as soon as possible!
<br/>
The material will be available for free after the event has completed, but no live recording will be available.
