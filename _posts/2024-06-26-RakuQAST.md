What the hell is this QAST?

# RAKU QAST: What is It?

While digging into the great language that is Raku, I encountered the term **QAST**, that stands for the **Q Abstract Syntax Tree**.

Wait a minute! What does that *Q* stands for?

Since I was not able to figure it out, I asked on the `#raku` IRC channel, and get pointed to a very detailed post by the great guru Damian Conway [describing how to extends the Raku grammar to support a for..else statement](https://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2019/09/itchscratch.html){:target="_blank"}. While the `for...else` statement is another idea per-se, at a certain point in the blog post, Damian writes about the **QAST**, defining it as **“Quisquous Abstract Syntax Tree”**.

But Damian being Damian, this is a joke, as shown in the tooltip:

So essentially, *QAST* stands for nothing, and it is the normal evaluation of `PAST` with the `P` increased into `Q` for the new version (remember, Raku was originally the next version of Perl).
