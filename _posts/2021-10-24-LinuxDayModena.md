# Linux Day in Modena: an Introduction to Raku

Yesterday it was the **Italian Linux Day**, and after *nine years* I came back to this great event as a speaker in my own city, Modena.
<br/>
I was at previous events, but as a participant, but this year I had the opportunity to speak again.
<br/>
<br/>
I decided to present an introductory talk about **Raku**, the title of the talk was *"Il linguaggio della farfallina"* ("The butterfly language").
<br/>
I've extracted the [video recording of my talk (in italian) and placed it online](https://odysee.com/@fluca1978:d/2021_LINUXDAY_RAKU:7){:target="_blank"}:

The talk is a brief and quick introduction to Raku, and in order to demonstrate some features of the language I decided to implement the `cat(1)` Unix command in Raku. Therefore, I shown how to handle `IO` roles, how to use postfix operators like `for` and `if`, how to concatenate different method calls (method chaining), and how to deal with the topic.
<br/>
The I explained about classes, and provided a *controversial* example about *people and green pass* and how roles can help mapping these concepts to data structures.
<br/>
Last I did provide a quick example on *grammars*.
<br/>
My slide were too much to be shown in the *40 minutes* slot I had, but probably they will become available from the event organizers.

# About the Linux Day 2021

The Linux Day has been organized perfectly by the [Make It Modena](https://www.comune.modena.it/makeitmodena){:target="_blank"} and the local Linux User Group (LUG) [Conoscere Linux](https://conoscerelinux.org/chi-siamo/){:target="_blank"}.
<br/>
Unluckily it was not possible to get it with live participant, so we (the speakers) were gathered in a room from which we were streaming the talks to high schools and other interested participants.
<br/>
So far, I collected positive reactions.
<br/>
The full video of the event is available on YouTube:

**It is probably the first time in ten or more eyars that I deliver a talk that has nothing to do with PostgreSQL**, and I always wanted to give a talk about Perl without finding out the right event, so I'm glad I had this opportunity.
