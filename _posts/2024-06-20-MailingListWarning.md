A strange email in my inbox...

# Mailing (list) spying...

Today I received the following email:

<hr/>
<center>
<br/>
<br/>
<img src="/images/posts/be_professional/be_professional_3.png" alt="" />
<br/>
<br/>
</center>

<hr/>

Without having to release any particular delay, I found very curios that this mailing list was alerting me that I was not opening previous emails.

How did the mailing list service know that I was not opening previous emails?

Well, clearly the trick is well known and very old: depending on the HTML content (downloaded at the email rendering), they can understand who is reading the emails (e.g., a blank image connected with an hash to my account or email address).
But the point is not the tecnique they used, **rather the fact they are clearly admitting they are spying on me!**

Sorry pal, wrong message at all!
