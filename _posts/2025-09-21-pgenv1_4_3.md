A new minor release for the beloved tool to build and manage multiple PostgreSQL instances.

# pgenv 1.4.3 is out!

[pgenv 1.4.3](https://github.com/theory/pgenv/releases/tag/v1.4.3){:target="_blank"} is out!
This minor release fixes a problem in the build of *release candidate* versions (e.g., `18rc1`) by stripping out all the text part from a version number using a Bash regular expression.
